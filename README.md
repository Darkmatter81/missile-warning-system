# Missile Warning System

This app allows operators to notify all the residents of Rungway Island of an impending missile attack, most likely from our arch nemesis Tim Young-One. Tim is fiercely jealous of our beautiful hoodies, and he'll do anything to destroy us because hooded clothes are banned in his country. 

Sadly, this system isn't quite up-to-scratch. We've had a few instances where our operators have accidentally sent live missile warnings instead of tests because they clicked the wrong button, and other cases where the operator hasn't had enough context and has missed sending warnings that should have gone out. So, we'd like you to make a few improvements:

- Adjust the UX for triggering the warning so as to reduce the tendancy for errors
- Add a feed of missile-related tweets to the application
- Send the missile warning to Twitter
